### Hello there!

My name is Florian Blume and I'm a PhD student in the field of machine learning/computer vision at TU Berlin. I'm currently working on facial expression recognition in light of context information, like affective knowledge about a person.

[This is my linked in](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-blume-bb303084/), [this my research gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Florian-Blume) and [this my stackoverflow profile](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3165451/florian-blume).

Besides machine learning I'm interested in computergraphics, OpenGL, Qt3D and some other stuff. I made a [tool to annotate 2D images with the 6D pose of 3D models](https://github.com/florianblume/6d-pat) and implemented several things for Qt3D ([widget integration](https://github.com/florianblume/qt3d-widget), [offscreen renderer](https://github.com/florianblume/Qt3D-OffscreenRenderer), [gizmo](https://github.com/florianblume/qt3d-gizmo), and some other things).
